# CICD Pipeline For Deploying AWS Resources 

The Provided code will deploy the AWS resources in AWS by CICD pipeline. You need to run terraform apply to initialize the pipeline.
After that you just need to push terraform code for required resources to gitlab and CICD pipeline will create those resources for you.
To destroy the resources, you just need to remove the code from gitlab repository.
